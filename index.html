    <p>This page summarizes all the events in <a href="https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html">FTL Advanced Edition</a>.
       I created it because I got tired of wading through slow wiki pages and unreadable XML data files,
       when I am trying to remember what a particular event does.
       Use Ctrl-F to find the event your are looking for, and have fun!
       <p>Note: Some events in the list may be test/debug events, which cannot be encountered via normal gameplay.

Your crew tries to keep the crowds in line but the scene quickly turns ugly. Half-crazed with fear, the infected grab mining tools and push back at your crew, forcing them to retreat hastily.

With the visible threat of your weapons, the infected become subdued enough for you to set up a rudimentary quarantine. However before you leave, one of your crew presents signs of infection.

The refugee ship cuts communications and jumps from the system without another word, the galactic equivalent of giving you the cold shoulder.

<li> [1/2]
The refugees become desperate at your refusal - apparently, their hull is even more damaged than it first appears. Almost begging, they offer a better trade than before.

<ol>
<li><span class="option">Accept it.</span>

<ul><li><strong>Receive</strong> 6 fuel

</ol>
</ul>
</div>
<li><span class="option">The helpless refugees make easy targets. Attack them.</span>

Panicked, the refugees immediately surrender as your weapons power up. They pass along their fuel and what few other supplies they have left in exchange for their lives.

<div class="indent">
A refugee ship fleeing the Rebel advance enters the system, having picked up your distress beacon. While it doesn&#x27;t have much fuel to spare, it is bad need of armaments and is willing to trade for them.

<ol>
<li><span class="option">Offer some missiles for fuel.</span>
<div>
<ul>
<li> [1/2]
The refugee ship makes the exchange, and wishes you well on your mission.
<ul><li><strong>Receive</strong> 5-7 fuel
<li><strong>Pay</strong> 1 missile</ul>
<li> [1/2]
Having traded supplies, the ship suddenly powers up and attacks - it&#x27;s a pirate ship!

<li> [1/4]
The refugee ship apologizes, but they need their fuel. They wish you well, and then vanish from the system.

<li> [1/4]
Sensing your reluctance, the refugee ship nevertheless parts with a small amount of fuel. It warns you to leave the sector as quickly as possible before it is overtaken by Rebels, then it jumps and vanishes to parts unknown.
<ul><li><strong>Low</strong> fuel</ul>
<li> [2/4]
Taking your reluctance as weakness, the refugee ship suddenly bristles with weapons - it&#x27;s a pirate ship, and it believes it&#x27;s found easy prey!
